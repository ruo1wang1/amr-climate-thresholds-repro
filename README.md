# AMR–Climate association thresholds (reproducibility repository)

This repository contains code, documentation, and anonymized analysis-ready country/region–year datasets to reproduce the main analyses for the manuscript:
"Ambient Temperature Variations and Antimicrobial Resistance: A Multi-country Analysis of Nonlinear Relationships and Temperature Thresholds".

## Contents
- `data/derived/`: anonymized, analysis-ready country/region–year panel datasets (one file per pathogen–drug combination)
- `data/metadata/`: data dictionary (`data_dictionary.csv`)
- `scripts/`: end-to-end pipeline (data processing → models → figures/tables)
- `code/`: reusable functions (to be added)
- `env/`: environment specifications (to be added)

## Quick start (to be completed)
1) Set up the software environment (see `env/`).
2) Run the pipeline:
   - `scripts/00_master_pipeline.R`

## Data notes
- The datasets under `data/derived/` are derived/anonymized datasets prepared for reproducibility.
- If any upstream third-party datasets cannot be redistributed, they are not re-hosted here; instead, we provide source links and scripted retrieval/processing instructions (see `data/README.md`).

## Reproducible outputs (to be completed)
- Main figures/tables: generated by scripts under `scripts/`
- Supplementary sensitivity analyses: scripts and outputs to be added

## Citation
See `CITATION.cff`.
